# CS484 - Image Analysis Term Project

Term project for Image Analysis, CS484, in Fall 2016 at Bilkent University.

In a nutshell, create a bag-of-words model for images in the training set using SIFT for feature extraction, train an binary classifiers using SVM for different object types to be recognized in the test set, and test the segments resulting from the normalized cut as test objects.
